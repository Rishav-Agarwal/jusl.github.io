      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="para">This is an educational website currently under development. It is being developed by the students of Jadavpur Uiversity. It aims at providing course contents to the students of <strong>Jadavpur University</strong> only. The objective is to host materials on all courses taught in Jadavpur University, make course related materials easily and reliably available and act as a guide to the learning path for a particular course. Basically we want to help students to have all resources easily available for better learning of a particular course. Presently, we are focusing only on <strong>Department of Information Technology</strong>. In future, however, we would expand to include other departments.
      </p>

      <h2>How can you benefit from this website?</h2>
      <p class="para">We intend to provide content like <strong>lecture slides, class notes, assignments, previous year question papers and solved solutions</strong> for majority of the courses.
      </p>
      <p class="para"> 
      We also plan to create study guides of various courses. We plan to accumulate all the videos sources and links which might be helpful for better understanding of the subject. 
      </p>

      <h2>Would you like to be a part of the team?</h2>
      <p class="para">
      Presently our team is very small. We are looking for students from all departments. We want both developers and content contributors. Any student who would like to be a part of our initiative can email us at <strong>jufet.github.io@gmail.com</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="para">
      Or you could simply help us by sending your course related study materials at: <strong>jufet.github.io@gmail.com</strong>
      </p>
