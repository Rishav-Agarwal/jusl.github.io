      <h1>Vision</h1>
      This is an educational website being created in hopes of helping students of Jadavpur University be <strong>better leaners</strong> .
      We want to be the best place to visit , if a student needs any help regarding the curriculum followed by departments in Jadavpur University . 
      Presently , we are <strong>focused on Department of Information Technology</strong> , because of our familiarity with the courses . In future , if time and costs permit , we would surely expand to include other departments . 

      <h1>How do we plan to make our peers <strong>better learners</strong> ?</h1>

      The objective is to host materials on <strong><em>all courses</em></strong> taught to the students <strong><em>in one place</em></strong>. Resources like lecture slides, assignment questions, previous year question papers , there solutions and class notes will be uploaded and will be open to all. We also plan to create study guides of various courses . It is important to study from the best place on Internet by the best people . We plan to accumulate all the videos sources and links which will surely increase the understanding of a course . </p>
      <br>

      We hope , our efforts makes some difference in our peers lives :-)

      <h1>We need you help _/\_</h1>

      The resources are infinite . And we wont be able to do it on our own .<br/>
